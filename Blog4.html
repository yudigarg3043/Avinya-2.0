<p>A new privacy report ranking the top 15 social media platforms found Reddit and Snapchat as the least intrusive on their users’ privacy. At the other end of the spectrum were Meta products Facebook, Messenger and Instagram.

    The ranking performed by data removal service Incogni was based on 14 criteria across five key categories: transgressions, data collection and retention, user control and consent, transparency, and user-friendliness.
    
    “Our researchers have created a comprehensive privacy ranking that reveals significant variations in the data-protection practices of these platforms,” the company wrote in its ranking report.
    
    The three platforms with the best privacy scores were Reddit, with an 8.9 score, Snapchat (9.99), and Pinterest (10.49).</p>

<div class="head"><h4>The Powerful Open</h4></div>
<p>In the opening moments of an event like this, you can often see where a company’s heart and focus are. It might do something humorous or feature the leading offering, but occasionally, I am surprised, and this was one of those times.
Lenovo opened with a demonstration featuring an individual with advanced ALS who cannot speak and can only move her eyes. But Lenovo had fashioned an AI solution for her so that, using AI, she could talk again. This breakthrough is monumental for individuals with ALS, enabling both speech and online interaction.</p>

<div class="head"><h4>User as Product</h4></div>
<p>Mike Machado, CISO of BeyondTrust, a maker of privileged account management and vulnerability management solutions in Carlsbad, Calif., asserted that the word “invasive” is key to Incogni’s report. “The less invasive platforms are, the less interested they are at trying to monetize the user as their product,” he told TechNewsWorld.

    “The worst offenders are like thinly disguised pleasure island traps, to use a Pinocchio analogy,” he said. “What appears to be the product is just a lure to get you to provide information about yourself and use the platform in ways that generate more information about yourself, with the end goal being for that business to monetize you and information about you as their real revenue stream.”</p>

    <div class="head"><h4>Out of Control User Controls</h4></div>
    <p>Purdue Global’s Rana added that not only do Facebook and LinkedIn collect a lot of data about their users, but they also make it difficult for users to protect their data from the grasping hands of the platforms. “Facebook is not very user-friendly in terms of their privacy settings,” she said.

        “LinkedIn has really complex privacy settings that can be difficult for many people to navigate, especially if you look at the wide range of users that are on that platform, ranging from technical to non-technical,” she continued. “It can be really complex to understand what those privacy settings are.”
        
        She also noted that LinkedIn shares data with third-party recruiters and companies and collects lots of professional and personal information. “That makes it more prone to having higher privacy risks,” she observed.</p>

    <div class="head"><h4>Can Privacy Be Protected?</h4></div>
        <p>For users concerned about their privacy on social media platforms, Megan Celestini, founder of Queen Bee Social, a social media marketing company in Cape Coral, Fla., offers this advice:

            Before signing up for a platform, read how they will use your information and photos. It’s important to know what you are agreeing to.
            Be cautious of what you post. So many people give away very sensitive information. One example I often see is children sharing adorable back-to-school photos in front of your house with their school and teacher’s names on their celebration board</p>
        <div class="head"><h4>Wrapping Up</h4></div>
        <p>However, some people believe preserving privacy may be a lost cause. “At this point, whatever information these platforms want to get, they will get,” declared Gary Flayter, celebrity brand and social media director at Kronus Communications, a public relations firm in Salt Lake City.

            “You use your face to unlock your phone. If you have a new MacBook laptop, you use your fingerprint to log in,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Your information is out there, either through social media or a smartphone.”
            
            “If you’re really that worried about privacy,” he said, “delete all your social media accounts and use a flip phone.”</p>
